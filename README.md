# Customer Segmentation for Arvato Financial Services

In this project, supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used to analyze demographical datasets of a general population as well as of customers of a German mail-order company. The goal of the project is twofold:

1. Cluster the datasets into groups to find out characteristics of existing customers and differences to general population
2. Develop a forecasting model to predict and identify prospective customer response for a marketing campaign

This is one of Udacityâ€™s capstone project for the Data Science Nanodegree program. The data is provided by Arvato Financial Services, a Bertelsmann subsidiary.

The complete project report can be found in <a href=https://medium.com/@matthias_h2609/customer-segmentation-for-arvato-financial-services-ffb089f2017f>this blogpost</a>.

## Installation
To run the Jupyter notebooks and python scripts, you will need a standard installtion of Anaconda with Python 3.6.x

Additional libraries needed:
- sklearn
- imblearn

## Data
The data used for this project not publically available. It was provided only to those participating in the "in class" competition.

## Files
- features.csv - data dictionary
- Arvato Report.pdf - Analysis report

## Instructions
### Customer Segmentation Report
1. Clean population and customer data

  - From the segmentation directory, run:
  <pre>python clean_data.py [data_dir]/Udacity_AZDIAS_052018.csv ../features.csv</pre>

  - From the segmentation directory, run:
  <pre>python clean_data.py [data_dir]/Udacity_CUSTOMERS_052018.csv.csv ../features.csv</pre>

2. Run the Customer Segmentation Report notebook

### Marketing predictions
1. Clean the training and test data
- From the supervised directory, run:
  <pre>python clean_data.py [data_dir]/Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TRAIN.csv ../features.csv</pre>

- From the supervised directory,
  <pre>run: python clean_data.py [data_dir]/Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TEST.csv ../features.csv</pre>

2. Run the Supervised Learning Using Ensemble Methods notebook

## Results
The detailed analysis of the results can be read in [this Medium post](https://medium.com/@mei.eisenbach/arvato-bertelsmann-customer-analysis-ae1aac59a1ef) or in Arvato Report.pdf.

### Customer segmentation
- One group was found to be more likely to be customers: These indivduals were more religious, older and savers.
- Two groups were found to be less likely to be customers: 1) Individuals with low purchasing activity and wealth (also younger) and 2) Individuals from areas with low population density and were less cultural minded/religiousness

### Marketing predictions
The final model had an auc_roc score of 0.76294 and a Kaggle score of 0.80143 (https://www.kaggle.com/c/udacity-arvato-identify-customers/leaderboard).

Model | Local score |Kaggle Score
--- | --- | ---
Gradient Boost | 0.76524 | 0.79327
AdaBoost | 0.76238 | 0.79791
LightGBM (final) | 0.76294 | 0.80143
