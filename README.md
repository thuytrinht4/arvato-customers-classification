# Customer Segmentation for Arvato Financial Services

In this project, supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used to analyze demographical datasets of a general population as well as of customers of a German mail-order company. The project has three major steps: the customer segmentation report, the supervised learning model, and the Kaggle Competition.

1. **Customer Segmentation Report**: use unsupervised learning methods to analyze attributes of established customers and the general population in order to create customer segments.
2. **Supervised Learning Model**: use dataset with attributes from targets of a mail order campaign and the previous segmentation analysis to build a machine learning model that predicts whether or not each individual will respond to the campaign.
3. **Kaggle Competition**: use the developed supervised model to make predictions on the campaign data as part of a Kaggle Competition.

This is one of Udacityâ€™s capstone project for the Data Science Nanodegree program. The data is provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics.

The complete project report can be found in [this Medium post](https://medium.com/@thuytrinht4/customer-segmentation-for-arvato-financial-services-4cec6745a20d).

## Installation
To run the Jupyter notebooks and python scripts, you will need a standard installation of Anaconda with Python 3.6.x

Additional libraries needed:
- sklearn

## Data
The data used for this project not publicly available. It was provided only to those participating in the "in class" competition.
